70415478:ive encountered beetles, cockroaches and moths. i think some ppl had harmless tree snakes in their rooms(?) HHAHA
70415478:yeaa tower block has the least bcuz it‚Äôs built like raffles hall
70415478:the older blocks have more insects
70415478:yeaaa
70415478:90% of the rooms iirc are single non-aircon
70415478:SNAKE?!?!

70415478:Oh wait that‚Äôs good haha
70415478:Haha why didn‚Äôt you opt for aircon tho?
70415478:looks like a colorful cable ü§£

70415478:eh i don‚Äôt rly use my ac at home either so i didnt see the point HAHAH
70415478:Oh my‚Ä¶ what ingenious camouflaging ü§£
70415478:Ohh I see
70415478:On no wonder haha that‚Äôs good actually, save electricity
70415478:How are RC mods conducted?
70415478:like normal classes but inside the rc HAHAH
70415478:Ohh
70415478:Is it mostly classroom style right?
70415478:Are there any lecture kind?
70415478:yea
70415478:idts? it‚Äôs all small classes for rc mods
70415478:Oh that‚Äôs nice!
70415478:How‚Äôs the workload of RC mods like?
70415478:And how often do y‚Äôall have to go outdoors?
70415478:uhh a little less than a normal mod
70415478:like 2-3 field trips per sem iirc HAHHA
70415478:Oh that‚Äôs nice
70415478:Oh cool
70415478:Wait how many RC mods per sem?
70415478:just 1 haha
70415478:Oh wait that‚Äôs not bad eh
70415478:Are the RC mods fun? üòÇ
70415478:yea i guess they‚Äôre pretty chill

70415478:Oh that's nice haha
70415478:Oh yes
70415478:Oh wait how does the mod bidding work?
70415478:just go to modreg and bid for the mods u want to take? haha i think you‚Äôll get it when u have to do it
70415478:Oh wait so it's thru the same process as bidding normal CS mods also?
70415478:For the RCs mods right, is it each sem you have a choice to choose from a bunch of different mods, or are they fixed and all must take it?
70415478:oh rc mods are like allocated to you but u have to choose the timeslot
70415478:Oh
70415478:Cool
70415478:For field trips, when are they usually held on? Will they clash with your normal CS lessons?
70415478:usually it's during the normal lesson time so normally there would not be a clash

70415478:Oh yea haha it was only opened for 2 hours
70415478:but it's fine we didn't stand a chance against the competition anyways üòÜ
70415478:Btw do you have any tips for mod bidding and academic plan declaration? I'm quite lost haha
70415478:Yo btw are you planning to buy taylor swift concert tixs?
70415478:ooo acad plan asap and i think they will allocate most mods to u for year 1 sem 1
70415478:ooo the queue seems so long tho
70415478:Damn asap as in I must declare now?
70415478:Oh HAHA are you queueing now?
70415478:nahh
70415478:oh idk when it‚Äôs available for y1s to declare
70415478:oh haha
70415478:wait you're a swiftie right?
70415478:ah i think mine starts on 19 July or sth
70415478:actually what's the purpose of declaring academic plan?
70415478:I heard that it renews each year? how come you can keep declaring?
70415478:i listen to some of her songs but not rly haha why
70415478:if u declare second major focus area etc u get priority for those classes
70415478:eg. math major gets priority to math classes ai focus area gets gets priority for ai classes
70415478:but u need to declare everytime to bid for classes. u cannot bid otherwise
70415478:Oh I see haha
70415478:ohh!
70415478:wait... do you mean that I can whack math minor just to get priority on math mods, then the next year, I change my mind?
70415478:yea sure if u want
70415478:Btw right NUSMods is just a platform to help you schedule your classes right?
70415478:but after that, the actual schedule you get depends on the results of the ModReg right?
70415478:yup
70415478:Ah I see thanks!
70415478:Yo do you have any advise for min specs for laptops for CS?
70415478:I kind need a new laptop, but idk what to get lmao
70415478:actly anything would do tbh
70415478:but i guess 16 gb ram and maybe like 512 gb ssd would be enough to run vms, have enough space for all the softwares/ides and open a lot of chrome tabs HAHAHA
70415478:as I‚Äôm saying that, I‚Äôm literally using my potato intel mac from 2017 with 8gb ram and like 128 gb ssd that has been working fine hahah
70415478:mac might be easier to install things and use terminal but tbh u cld get any windows laptop and run linux also
70415478:I see!
70415478:Oh yea need to run VMs too haha
70415478:Woah actually?! Wow that‚Äôs incredible haha
70415478:Ah run Linux as it double boot?
70415478:Btw what things are easier to install on Mac?
70415478:things like node you can just use brew to install using terminal instead of downloading on the website like on windows
70415478:you can dual boot or just use it as ur main os like some ppl haha
70415478:Oh that‚Äôs interesting I didn‚Äôt know that
70415478:Wait actually?
70415478:Damn that‚Äôs interesting haha
70415478:Oh yea also are there tests or exams that are administered online on your laptop?
70415478:How does that work?
70415478:yupp u download a software called Examplify
70415478:Oh I see
70415478:Damn so if you no laptop, then you're in trouble basically haha
70415478:Btw do you see a lot of your peers using ThinkPads?
70415478:uhhhhh i'm not sure tbh i see more macbooks than thinkpads i think
70415478:i think you can loan laptops from nus but idk anyone who has
70415478:Oh wow I see
70415478:but for windows users, are most of them using ThinkPads?
70415478:Oh I see
70415478:nah idts
70415478:Ah I see
70415478:Oh yea btw, do you bid for RVRC mods together with the other mods?
70415478:i think you can only bid for rvrc mods from round 2
70415478:Ohh
70415478:actually on that topic, why are there 3 rounds of mod bidding? what is the diff between them anyways?
70415478:if u don‚Äôt get modules in one round, you bid in the next round haha
70415478:Oh! Haha I see
70415478:Did you bring a mini-fridge into RC last time?
70415478:no
70415478:there‚Äôs a pantry fridge for each floor u can use haha
70415478:Oh I see!
70415478:But is it safe putting your foodstuff in the communal fridge? ü§£
70415478:i just wrap mine in 2 plastic bags hahaha
70415478:but they did clean the fridge from time to time from what I remember
70415478:oh nice haha
70415478:ah that's good
70415478:any instances of rotten stuff inside the fridge, or your food going missing? üòÜ
70415478:btw which mods would you recommend haha
70415478:1001 is quite fun and the prof is q nice
70415478:Oh interesting!
70415478:Cuz some of my friends are planning to take that to haha
70415478:What is it about anyways?
70415478:And how applicable is it, cuz it‚Äôs about science fiction? ü§£
70415478:yo wait sorry urgent... for your first year academic plan declaration, what did you choose?
70415478:do we need to fill in tracks? Cuz i've been hearing conflicting advice on that haha
70415478:just computer science as ur primary major and rvrc prog
70415478:u don‚Äôt need to as y1
70415478:ur taking cs1101s rite
70415478:applicable to what? i mean u just read and watch science fiction and write some papers abt it in the mod
70415478:Ah I see
70415478:Yep
70415478:Can thanks a lot! Cuz I was really confused about the other fields HAHAHA
70415478:Applicable as in to real life haha. Like rn I see the mod as fun rather than useful
70415478:uhhh i think most ge mods arent that useful in general‚Ä¶ but i think all the rvx moddds s teach u academic writing with different content?
70415478:Ohh I see
70415478:haha i'm going to die in that: I suck at writing üòÜ
70415478:Btw right I apparently got pre-allocated a GEA mod, but the thing is I'm already going to do another GE mod in RVRC. Do you know if I can drop that pre-allocated GEA mod or sth?
70415478:i think u shld just do it in sem 1 cus tbh u would still have to do it by y2? i think
70415478:just use ur SUs haha
70415478:oh right!
70415478:Oh actually
70415478:Hmm but doing two GEs in a sem... would that be a waste? Cuz I could use one of the mod space to quickly clear a math mod or sth that is a pre-requisite for other mods
70415478:idk what are your thoughts? Haha
70415478:Oh yea also for the science fiction mod, what kind of stuff did you have to watch?
70415478:actly dunnid to rush since u can overload in sem 2 and if u think GEs might be ur weaker mods u shld clear them in y1 when u can use sus
70415478:but if u wanna then go ahead haha
70415478:oh like black panther, black mirror, ghost in the shell etc
70415478:Ah that's a good idea
70415478:damn but isn't overloading pretty stressful? haha
70415478:ah so technically I can still do the GEs in sem 2 if I want to SU them?
70415478:woah that sounds cool!
70415478:i mean if ur gonna su something then it shld b ok
70415478:but honestly u can finish cs wo overloading at all also
70415478:yea i guess
70415478:Oh serious? Nice
70415478:Can thanks for advising!
70415478:Btw have you completed GEA1000?
70415478:Oh yea do you mind sharing what mods you took in Sem 1? üòÜ
70415478:yup
70415478:cs1101s, cs1231, ma2001, ma1521 and rvn1000 iirc
70415478:Oh nice which sem did you complete it in?
70415478:Ah I see
70415478:wow you spam both math mods in the same sem? how did that go?
70415478:oh it went ok tbh i think i got allocated both math mods or smthng like that haha
70415478:y1s2
70415478:Woah!
70415478:No wonder
70415478:I see
70415478:Oh you didn‚Äôt take ST1231 instead?
70415478:Btw did you bring any monitors or desktops into the hall?
70415478:nope rvrc has monitors/desktops u can borrow in the e resource library
70415478:u mean st2334? i mean im doing a math second major alr and not stats so i just took st2334
70415478:Ohh
70415478:That‚Äôs nice
70415478:So you could do your hardcore work over there?
70415478:Ohh
70415478:Wait no I actually meant ST1231, cuz I heard a lot of people are using ST1231 to replace GEA1000 to fulfil the Data Literacy pillar. I understand that ST2334 is another mod that is compulsory under the CS degree requirements
70415478:But since you took GEA1000, how was that? ü§£
70415478:p chill. like 0 effort tbh haha i got carried by my team
70415478:urm sure? idk what u mean by hardcore but i guess?
70415478:Yo nice! ü§£
70415478:Oh haha I meant like more intense work where you can‚Äôt just do on your own Pc and need theirs
70415478:Anyways what was your house in RVRC?
70415478:oo i was in panthera
70415478:what‚Äôs ur hse

70415478:Pretty fun so far haha
70415478:ooo that‚Äôs good
70415478:Imo much better than FSC ü§£
70415478:Also btw, do you know anything about the other RVX mods?
70415478:I‚Äôm taking of adding a reserve mod since RVX1001 has overwhelming demand. Which would you recommend?
70415478:I think the other mods are new tbh. iirc citizen speak was not that fun according to my friends last sem but the rest should be ok? hahah
70415478:I see!
70415478:rly? how was that? i was in the organizing comm like a year ago HAHAHA
70415478:Woah mugger!
70415478:As in you planned last year‚Äôs FSC?
70415478:yeahh
70415478:was it as bad as last year?
70415478:well... idk about last year's one HAHA
70415478:so I can't comment on that
70415478:but based on my personal comparison between this year's FSC and RVRC, I felt that the RVRC one was better
70415478:but this my personal opinion based on what I felt, so it's a bias perspective haha
70415478:ooo i see HAHAHA
70415478:was it a lot of just waiting/buffer time in fsc haha?
70415478:not really haha
70415478:it was quite well planned I felt
70415478:but the reason I felt RVRC was better is cuz of it's activites
70415478:I liked the RVRC activities more haha
70415478:as compared to FSC
70415478:because FSC had a lot of sports games, and I suck at sports, so I didn't really enjoy it
70415478:meanwhile, RVRC had more things like tree-planting, riddles and team building games which I felt was more inclusive and more fun
70415478:and yea the amazing race, where you go around and find things, or like play mini games
70415478:those don't need a specific skill imo, and was more inclusive in general, so I enjoyed those
70415478:oh yea btw right, what usually happens in week 0?
70415478:In both CS and RVRC?
70415478:oh uh nothing iirc
70415478:there might be some lectures tho
70415478:but that‚Äôs it

70415478:Oh!

70415478:Nah HAHA I went to sleep at 5
70415478:And now I‚Äôm going to jam at jukebox at 11
70415478:With 4 hours of sleep üò≠
70415478:oh damn good luck haha

70415478:And the vice house-head of Panthera who is also a jukebox member said she really liked my voice HAHAHA
70415478:ooo nice
70415478:Btw did you use your PSEA Funds to pay for RC?
70415478:nah my scholarship paid for it
70415478:Oh wait your scholarship covers RC also?!
70415478:Noice!
70415478:yea
70415478:wah so good siol haha
70415478:Yo what do you think of such a timetable planning? Any advice? üòÖ
70415478:Damn sway sia... got the RV mod in the middle of the day
70415478:woah damn ur schedule seems v packed
70415478:my timetable
70415478:i guess u can't really change it also cus of the 8 am lectures and stuff but at least u have e-learning i guess hahaha
70415478:but i think y1 schedule will b like that
70415478:oh legit? HAHAHA
70415478:damn i tot it was quite okay already since i at least managed to free one day hahaha
70415478:oh yea that's quite a bummer
70415478:but I was thinking of skipping the lecture and review the recording instead
70415478:but i need to find out if the lecture is even recorded in the first place haha
70415478:holy crap that's an amazing timetable bro!!!
70415478:I now see why there's no need to stay on campus in senior years hahaha
70415478:btw do you have any tips on how to plan back-up tutorial slots?
70415478:like basically the 2nd and 3rd choices
70415478:i think these go after the slots you chose for all ur modules
70415478:but during the add/drop period you can just switch around classes quite easily
70415478:Oh yes
70415478:So what‚Äôs the strat? ü§£
70415478:i think i read somewhere on reddit that it should be like A,B,C,D,A,B,C,D
70415478:where A,B,C,D are unique modules
70415478:then put the slots u need first
70415478:the negotiable tut slots at the back
70415478:smthng like that
70415478:I see!
70415478:Oh yea I heard of this technique haha
70415478:But wait so how do you decide which are ‚Äúnegotiable tut slots‚Äù?
70415478:Also btw how detrimental is it if you don't end up getting the same tutorial slots as you friends and end up with complete strangers?
70415478:like tutorials u dont mind it being in multiple timeslots
70415478:not much. just make friends or just go to class as per normal haha
70415478:no one cares tbh
70415478:a lot of ppl go to slots alone
70415478:unless the mod has grpwork and u want to do it with friends, then u shld bid for the same tutorial slots
70415478:I see!
70415478:Ooh
70415478:Right that‚Äôs very important!
70415478:
70415478:also have you started coming to school alr?
70415478:oo not yet HAHHAHA online lectures this week
70415478:r u still in rv

70415478:is he not? i rmbr him telling me he applied
70415478:Oh he told me he didn‚Äôt get in
70415478:ohhhh
70415478:Unfortunately :(
70415478:oof
70415478:Wait I can do that with other RCs?
70415478:yeah u can transfer ur credits w anyone that has a meal plan
70415478:so like hall ppl too
70415478:but hall food sucks a word if caution
70415478:Ohh!
70415478:Wait I tried doing that and it didn‚Äôt work haha
70415478:is raj on campus tho?
70415478:For Kent Ridge hall
70415478:Oh actually? üò≠
70415478:I don‚Äôt think he managed to get into any place of residence
70415478:oh wut frr i rmbr it working but i guess u friend can just use their credits if it fails haha
70415478:Yea haha be treated me that day
70415478:But for some reason I felt that his hall food was better than RV one HAHAHA
70415478:But it could be a one off thing
70415478:yarhhhh it‚Äôs hella oily and jus lower quality than rc food
70415478:Damn HAHA
70415478:wut no wayyy my friend was also from kr and she told me the food sucks
70415478:I guess their meal plan is cheaper for a reason
70415478:Oh legit?
70415478:she grabs food in all the time üíÄ
70415478:Rip
70415478:Maybe people feedbacked? üòÇ

70415478:there were two sessions, one was based on the Cs1010 syllabus and one on the CS2040
70415478:I went for the latter and it was insane HAHAHA but it was really eye opening and informative!
70415478:we learn about describing time complexities of algorithms using Big O Notation
70415478:which I tot was damn interesting! Especially when things like P&C and Series suddenly start popping out in the the solution
70415478:woah mugger! Damn you're amazing HAHA
70415478:oh wait is CS1010r the extension of CS1101s where you get to clear one unit or something?
70415478:yeaaa

70415478:oh wow what is it abt haha
70415478:Some mod about communicating in inter cultural setting!
70415478:Aptly titled ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù
70415478:It was my last choice, so I was kinda dreading it at first
70415478:But then it turns out that the mod was very interesting (at least to me)!
70415478:It made us think very philosophically about languages and meaning behind the names we give concepts
70415478:oh nice
70415478:Oh wait what app do you use to make handwritten notes on your iPad again?
70415478:collanote!
70415478:Oh cool
70415478:Also btw where do you do your homework on?
70415478:Do you use old fashion pen and paper, or you do them on your iPad Air?
70415478:ipad haha
70415478:sometimes ill do on pen and paper for scratch work
70415478:woah mugger!
70415478:so you do it on collanote also?

70415478:so like you're learning a long of things very quickly
70415478:but other than the academics, RC life has been really fun
70415478:Especially the chalking session! üòÜ
70415478:ooo that‚Äôs nice to hear!
70415478:Is it possible to use collanote to open a pdf file in onedrive and ensure that it is sync across all devices?
70415478:yea i think collanote syncs across all devices. just download ur onedrive pdf file to ur ipad‚Äôs file storage and open it in collanote
70415478:ah I see... but won't that downloaded copy be independent from the one in OneDrive?
70415478:oh u want to sync it with onedrive?
70415478:idt u can do that but i guess in that case u should j use onenote for ur notes
70415478:yes
70415478:yea haha
70415478:Ohh!
70415478:wait but do you know if onenote can edit pdf files from onedrive tho?
70415478:i tried doing it but it made me import the file into onenote lol
70415478:But i want to be able to directly edit the pdf file and see the changes on my other machines
70415478:should be yes
70415478:there should be a save to onedrive option in onenote
70415478:same with word, powerpoint, excel etc
70415478:Ah
70415478:Okay that‚Äôs good
70415478:Thanks!

70415478:and i did my part. it took like 30 mins
70415478:Yo what a flex!
70415478:Wow‚Ä¶ wait so simple?
70415478:yea it was just reading some paragraph and identifying how to analyse the data or something like that
70415478:linear algebra? i heard it was hard this sem feelsbadman
70415478:Woah sounds easy HAHAHA
70415478:Yea ikr!
70415478:We all died bro
70415478:And it doesn‚Äôt help when there are absolutely no past year papers :(
70415478:oh it wasn‚Äôt like ma2001?
70415478:Yea bro
70415478:it was far from it
70415478:for one, MA1522 allows you to use matlab
70415478:that means the questions are way harder
70415478:since in MA2001, they can only test as much as you can manually calculate
70415478:my sem allowed that iirc
70415478:the prof victor tan semesters
70415478:have you signed up for hack n roll btw
70415478:Oh wait really?

70415478:Cool!
70415478:Yep!
70415478:I‚Äôll add you to our group haha
70415478:oo ok thanks!
70415478:Yo have you TAed before?
70415478:nahh
70415478:Oh lmao
70415478:Have you used vercel before?
70415478:oh yeah y? do u wanna deploy ur build with it or something?
70415478:yea lol
70415478:basically I'm in charge of deploying and I tot vercel was the most straightforward
70415478:but the issue now is that I'm not sure how to deploy if i'm not the owner of the project
70415478:like i'm just a collaborator basically
70415478:do you know if it's possible for a collaborator to deploy?
70415478:yea i assume u mean collaborator on github rite
70415478:just fork the project and deploy ur fork
70415478:ooh that's a smart move!
70415478:but the thing about the fork is that it won't be auto-updated by commits from the parent repo right?
70415478:like you've manually sync or something(?)
70415478:tbh u can prolly do it on the main branch too i think but im guessing u want it done fast haha
70415478:ooh wait wdym?
70415478:like u can deploy from the main repo too i think if u have permissions
70415478:ooh!
70415478:as a collaborator?
70415478:i can go home and check for ya
70415478:yea should be can we deployed our cs3219 project like that so
70415478:ooh!
70415478:is it with github actions or sth?
70415478:yea it‚Äôs annoying
70415478:mhmm i think so iirc
70415478:woah mugger!
70415478:then maybe it's worth learning!
70415478:thanks so much!!!
70415478:do update me hahaha
70415478:wait do u have my github
70415478:u can go check
70415478:@cjyothika
70415478:the cs3219 proj
70415478:just copy the yaml file if there is
70415478:Oh wait!
70415478:So the YAML file does everything for us basically
70415478:yup yup
70415478:u have docker right? ok but i guess there‚Äôs github actions
70415478:ooh i don't have docker lmao
70415478:i think jus set up github actions it will run it in the cloud
70415478:oh okay thanks!
70415478:btw what's your github account?
70415478:^^ this
70415478:cjyothika is the username
70415478:ooh okay thanks!
70415478:btw right only the owner of the repo can add secrets for the github action?
70415478:hmm i think the owner can give access to others to do that
70415478:oh yea i found out how alr!
70415478:but now i'm having some issues with env variables :(
70415478:somehow it doesn't work
70415478:oh wot ss maybe i can help
70415478:Can!
70415478:Gimme a sec
70415478:Omg I solved the issue
70415478:bruh this is so stupid
70415478:turns out I apparently didn't redeploy after configuring the env variables
70415478:so the app wasn't updated with it
70415478:but then I kept clicking redelpying tho
70415478:on vercel
70415478:in the end I had to redeploy manually from github actions for the change to take effect
70415478:oof i feel ya these things like forgetting to redeploy/recompile happen a lot to me too lol
70415478:ikr damn stupid... so many issues keeps popping up üò≠
70415478:but oh well it works now so... HAHAHA
70415478:Yo for CS2030S, is it okay to use your existing github account or is it advisable to make another one just for the course?
70415478:just use ur existing one haha
70415478:all u need is github classroom
